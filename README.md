> Smart contracts on Binance Chain via a decentralized sidechain bridge with NEO

## What?
SmartBNB is a project that enables Binance Chain tokens to use smart contracts in the NEO blockchain.

## How?
1. Binance Chain tokens are ported to the NEO blockchain via a trustless two-way peg that relies on SPV proofs and collateralization
2. Once in NEO, these ported tokens can be used in any smart contract available there
3. Finally these tokens can be redeemed for their real counterparts at any point in time.
