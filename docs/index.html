							<h2>What it is</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Essentially, smartBNB is <strong>a trustless bridge that enables Binance Chain tokens to use smart contracts in the NEO blockchain</strong>. This is achieved through a protocol that allows the porting of tokens from Binance Chain, such as BNB, to the NEO chain, without having to exchange the tokens for anything else in the process.<br><br>
							On a lower level, it works the same way sidechains do, tokens get locked in Binance Chain, and new tokens that represent those get minted on NEO. These new tokens can then be redeemed for the original versions through an unlocking process, and in the event of any irregularity, users are always made whole through a collateral pool.</p>

							<h2>How it works</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>smartBNB's protocol is based on <strong>fully-collateralized custodians</strong>, which are require to put down a bond of NEO tokens before they start acting as a custodian for coins on Binance Chain.<br><br>
							These custodians will then receive and safekeep any tokens from Binance Chain that are to be ported on to NEO, locking them in their vaults and having the protocol mint new tokens on NEO to represent them. Later, these tokens on NEO can be burnt by their holders in order to retrieve the locked tokens, which the custodians will be forced to send in order to prevent loss of their collateral, which greatly exceeds the value of the custodied tokens.<br><br>
							Because of this collateral, which is set to be around 150% of the value custodied, this protocol doesn't require any trust on the custodians, which are heavily incentivised to behave honestly and, in case they don't, the users are protected by giving them the collateral, which results in a value increase for them. Due to this, anyone can become a custodian.<br><br>

							<h2>Usecases</h2>

						<div class="content">
							<p>We expect the main use of the protocol will be to <strong>enable tokens on Binance Chain to use smart contracts</strong>, which in turn will enable the following:
